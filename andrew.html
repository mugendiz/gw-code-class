          I am a Tanzanian living in Silver Spring Maryland. Right now studying software development Bootcamp at George Washington University.

          I studied Urban Geography in the Netherlands at Roosevelt Academy and went on to pursue Graduate School studees in Massachusetts at Clark University. After this I began work at the Embassy of the United Republic of Tanzania in Wasnington, D.C. where I worked as a visa Clerk and later as a Foreign Service Officer.

          Upon Completion of my studies at George Washington University I will be a Full Stack Developer and be able to better serve at my current job and beyond.
